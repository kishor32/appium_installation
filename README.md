# appium_installation

Before executing the script make sure Xcode is installed from Apple app store. Also make sure Android Studio and Java is installed .
All other dependencies including JAVA_HOME and ANDROID_HOME will be set by the script itself.Â 
I am assuming that git is already installed in your machine. If not Please install it.
